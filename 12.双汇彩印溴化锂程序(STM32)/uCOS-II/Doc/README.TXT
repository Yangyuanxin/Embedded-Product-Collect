***************************** REPORTING PROBLEMS *****************************
******************************************************************************

    If  you find a problem (i.e. bug) in uC/OS-II, do not hesitate  to  report 
the problem to either:

 1) Through e-mail:

        My e-mail address is:   Jean.Labrosse@Micrium.com

 2) By writing to me at:

        Micrium
        949 Crestview Circle
        Weston, FL 33327
        U.S.A.

        c/o: Jean J. Labrosse

 3) By calling Micrium:

        (954) 217-2036
        (954) 217-2037, FAX

    Make sure that the problem you are  reporting is in  uC/OS-II and not your
application.    If you in fact discover a bug in uC/OS-II, check the  uC/OS-II 
web site for a list of known bugs and their fixes:

    www.Micrium.com

    If you are  using  an  older  version,  you should  first  get the lastest
version.

****************************** SOFTWARE UPGRADES *****************************
******************************************************************************

    As you can see, I have been trying to support uC/OS (i.e. V1.xx) and  now,
uC/OS-II.  When bugs are found, I do my best to promptly correct them.   It is 
virtually  impossible  to notify  everybody that  purchased the code (i.e. the 
diskette)  to  tell  them  that  a  new  version  is  available.    You should 
occasionally check the uC/OS-II WEB site (www.ucos-ii.com) or the  Micrium web
site (www.Micrium.com) to see what version is currently shipping.

    I will not be  upgrading the  publisher  everytime  I add new  features to
uC/OS-II.

    I  would  highly  suggest that you resist changing the  STYLE  of the code
unless you don't mind spending many hours doing so everytime you upgrade.
